# 🎭 Contributing to Modern SaaS Animated

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Modern SaaS Animated! 🎉 We're especially excited about contributions that enhance our **spectacular 6-layer floating circles animation** - the crown jewel of this template.

## 🌟 **Animation-First Development**

Modern SaaS Animated isn't just another SaaS template - it's home to the most mesmerizing web animation ever created. Our **6-layer floating circles animation** with 180+ rotating portraits is the heart of this template, and we welcome contributions that make it even more spectacular!

## 🎯 **Priority Contribution Areas**

### **🔥 Animation Enhancements** (Highest Priority)
- Performance optimizations for the 6-layer system
- New visual effects and interactions  
- Mobile responsiveness improvements
- Cross-browser compatibility fixes

### **🎨 Visual Improvements**
- UI/UX enhancements that complement the animation
- Color schemes and themes
- Typography and layout improvements

### **⚡ Performance Optimizations**
- Animation frame rate improvements
- Memory usage optimization
- Loading speed enhancements

## 🎬 **Animation Development Guidelines**

### **Before You Start**
- Study the existing animation code in `js/main.js` (lines 259-340)
- Read the `ANIMATION_SHOWCASE.md` for technical details
- Test your changes across all 6 layers
- Ensure 60fps performance is maintained

### **Animation Code Standards**
```javascript
// Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
function animateSpheres() {
  // Your animation logic here
  requestAnimationFrame(animateSpheres);
}

// Maintain mathematical precision for positioning
const angle = (2 * Math.PI / data.numPortraits) * i;
const x = data.radius * Math.cos(angle);
const y = data.radius * Math.sin(angle);

// Use CSS transforms for GPU acceleration
element.style.transform = `rotate(${rotation}deg)`;
```

### **Testing Checklist for Animation Changes**
- [ ] All 6 layers render correctly
- [ ] Performance stays at 60fps
- [ ] Works on mobile devices
- [ ] No memory leaks after extended use
- [ ] Scroll interaction remains smooth
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## 🎨 Style Guides

### JavaScript Style Guide

- Use **ES6+** features when possible
- Use **camelCase** for variables and functions
- Use **PascalCase** for classes and constructors
- Use **UPPERCASE** for constants
- Always use semicolons
- Use template literals instead of string concatenation

```javascript
// ✅ Good
const userName = 'JohnDoe';
const API_URL = 'https://api.example.com';

function getUserData(userId) {
  return `User ID: ${userId}`;
}

// ❌ Bad
var user_name = 'JohnDoe'
var api_url = 'https://api.example.com'

function get_user_data(user_id) {
  return 'User ID: ' + user_id
}
```

### CSS Style Guide

- Use **kebab-case** for class names
- Use **BEM methodology** when appropriate
- Use **CSS custom properties** for theme values
- Mobile-first responsive design

```css
/* ✅ Good */
.lead-card {
  --primary-color: #3b82f6;
  background-color: var(--primary-color);
}

.lead-card__header {
  font-size: 1.25rem;
}

.lead-card--featured {
  border: 2px solid var(--primary-color);
}

/* ❌ Bad */
.leadCard {
